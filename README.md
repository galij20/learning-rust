Repo for storing projects and concepts I learned progressively in the Rust Programming Language

### What is Rust?
Rust is a systems-level general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It is used in various industries as Embedded Systems and IoT, cloud infrastructures, Web3, Systems and Low-level programming, etc. Unlike other languages which either give the user the power to weild the power of memory which is error-prone or maintain a garbage collector which makes the programs slower in run-time, Rust introduces the concept of ownership and borrowing.


Follow along my learning journey with this repository and if you would also like to test the programs provided in this repository, perform the following steps.

**Step 1**: Clone the github repository in your terminal by using the following command.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/galij20/learning-rust.git
```
**Step 2**: cd into the clone and then the desired folder.
```bash
$ cd learning-rust/
$ cd hello_cargo
```
**Step 3**: After entering the desired directory, run the following command to run the rust builds and hence replicate my results.
```bash
$ cargo run
```
